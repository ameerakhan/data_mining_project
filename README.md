Classification of Popular News Articles: 

As the field of data science expands its horizons, there are more and more breakthrough techniques which help stakeholders to determine which aspects can maximize value for an organization. In particular, the media industry has readily taken up predictive analytics to spread information tailored to the tastes of viewers. Interestingly, with every human-based approach, there come biases which can create numerous ethical mistakes where viewers can receive distorted or even “fake” information Tandoc & Thomas (2015). As well as that, the Reuters Institute (2016) outline that news agencies are taking up “editorial analytics” in order to generate content which will become popular spread quickly and create value for the agency.
Therefore, it is imperative to investigate what exactly is being transmitted to viewers and to classify the characteristics of a popular news stories on an online platform. This analysis uses data from the online news website ‘Mashable’, which has been collected by Fernandez et al (2015). The data frame consists of 61 attributes out of which there are 2 identity variables and 58 predictors and classifiers. The aim of this analysis is to predict the popularity (number of shares of an article) and compare the accuracy of the predictions of different techniques used in data mining.
